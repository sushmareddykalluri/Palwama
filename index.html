            <h2>Background</h2>
<div>
<p>Kashmir is a disputed territory, claimed both by India and Pakistan with both countries administering part of the territory.
Pakistan has sought to gain control of Indian-administered Kashmir.
An insurgency began to proliferate in Indian-administered Kashmir in the late 1980s. 
Pakistan provided the insurgency with material support.Since 1989, about 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the Indian crackdown.
According to Time, unrest in Kashmir grew in 2016 after India killed a popular militant leader, Burhan Wani.
A rising number of young locals from Indian administered Kashmir have joined the militancy.
Many sources state that the majority of militants in Kashmir are now local, not foreign.
In 2018 alone, the death toll included 260 militants, 160 civilians and 150 government forces.
Since 2015, Pakistan-based militants in Kashmir have increasingly taken to high-profile suicide attacks against the Indian security forces. 
In July 2015, three gunmen attacked a bus, and police station in Gurdaspur. 
Early in 2016, four to six gunmen attacked the Pathankot Air Force Station.In February and June 2016, 
the militants killed nine and eight security personnel respectively in Pampore. 
In September 2016, four assailants attacked an Indian Army brigade headquarters in Uri killing 19 soldiers. 
On 31 December 2017, the Commando Training Centre at Lethpora was also attacked by militants killing five security personnel.
These attacks took place in the vicinity of the Jammu Srinagar National Highway.</p></div></class>

<h2>Attack</h2>
<class="Attack" id="Attack">
    <div>
 <p>On 14 February 2019, a convoy of 78 vehicles transporting more than 2,500 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)personnel from Jammu to Srinagar was travelling on National Highway 44.
 The convoy had left Jammu around 03:30 IST and was carrying a large number of personnel due to the highway having been shut down for two days prior.
 The convoy was scheduled to reach its destination before sunset.
At Lethpora near Awantipora, around 15:15 IST,a bus carrying security personnel was rammed by a car carrying explosives.
It caused a blast which killed 40 CRPF personnel of the 76th Battalion and injured many others.The injured were moved to the army base hospital in Srinagar.
Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack.
They also released a video of the assailant Adil Ahmad Dar, a 22-year old from Kakapora who had joined the group a year earlier.
Dar's family had last seen him in March 2018, when he left his house on a bicycle one day and never returned.
Pakistan denied any involvement, though Jaish-e-Mohammed's leader, Masood Azhar, is known to operate in the country.
It is the deadliest terror attack on India's state security personnel in Kashmir since 1989.</p></div>

<h2>Investigation</h2>
<class="Investigation" id="Investigation">
    <div>
The National Investigation Agency dispatched a 12-member team to probe the attack, working with the Jammu and Kashmir Police.
Initial investigations suggested the car was carrying more than 300 kilograms (660 lb) of explosives,including 80 kilograms (180 lb) of RDX, a high explosive,and ammonium nitrate.
Lt Gen Hooda said that the explosives might have been stolen from a construction site.
He initially said that it was not possible that they were smuggled from across the border,but later said that he could not rule it out.
National Investigation Agency was able to establish and confirm the identity of suicide bomber as DNA samples from "meagre fragments of the car" used in suicide attack matched with Adil Ahmad Dar's father. However, even after a year of investigation, NIA was unable to trace the source of explosives. </div>
